#### Anita Bandrowski
##### Specialist, Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego
##### Founder and CEO, SciCrunch
##### Co-Founder and lead, RRID Initiative
##### Berlin Institute of Health Visiting Professor, funded by Stiftung Charité

Dr Bandrowski trained as a bench neurophysiologist, working to elucidate physiological mechanisms of learning and epilepsy. However, soon after postdoc, Dr. Bandrowski began to work in data, starting with the annotation of the human genome for Celera Inc. Dr. Bandrowski moved to neuroinformatics with the award of the Neuroscience Information Framework by the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience. The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive list of databases for neuroscience, and led to the most comprehensive search system for neuroscience data on the web. Since then, Dr. Bandrowski's role moved to creating data structures that are accessible to multiple systems, or FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable); leading interdisciplinary teams to create community standards, and structuring data into formats that are accessible to artificial intelligence systems. Dr. Bandrowski also serves as the lead for the Research Resource Identification (RRID) Initiative. RRIDs are unique identifiers for Key Biological Resources, aggregated by our group from community databases and requested from authors in participating journals.

#### Ulrich Dirnagl
##### Director, Department of Experimental Neurology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin
##### Founding Director, BIG Quest Center for Transforming Biomedical Research

In preclinical as well as in clinical studies Ulrich Dirnagl’s research has revealed pathobiology which impact on the outcome after a stroke. These include deleterious as well as endogenous protective mechanisms, as interactions of the brain with other systems of the body after it has been injured. Several of these mechanism can be therapeutically targeted, clinical trials are under way. In addition, through meta-research he was able to identify opportunities for improving research practice and to obtain evidence for the impact of interventions targeted to increase the value of biomedical research. At the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin Ulrich Dirnagl serves as Director of the Department of Experimental Neurology. Since 2017 he is also the founding director of the QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research at the Berlin Institute of Health. QUEST aims at overcoming the roadblocks in translational medicine by increasing the value and impact of biomedical research through maximizing the quality, reproducibility, generalizability, and validity of research.
