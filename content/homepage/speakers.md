#### Odilia Lu
##### PhD candidate, University of California, Berkeley
Odilia Lu is a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley whose research incorporates approaches to improve rigor and reproducibility in behavioral neuroscience. Motivated by widespread reproducibility issues - particularly in animal behavior research, where methodological variation can strongly influence outcomes - she spearheaded a collaborative research model in which multiple laboratories perform the same experiments to efficiently identify robust and replicable effects. Using this approach, she led a multi-institutional collaboration of 40 scientists across five laboratories to define replicable effects of psilocybin on mouse behaviors relevant to depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In recognition of this work, she received the NINDS Early-Career Rigor Champions Prize.

#### Dr Matthew Schrag, PhD
##### MD, PhD, Vanderbuilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessse

Dr Matthew Schrag is a neurologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and runs the SchragLab at Vanderbilt, a neurobiology lab studying how the blood vessel network in the brain deteriorates in Alzheimer’s disease in a condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy. His group studies post-mortem human brain tissue with advanced microscopy techniques to create detailed measurements of the vascular network associated cerebrovascular degeneration along with cell and molecular biology techniques to define mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease that could lead to new approaches to treatment. The SchragLab’s work on the neuropathology of ARIA, a potentially dangerous side effect of anti-amyloid immunotherapies, contributed to the FDA’s decision to add a black box warning to the new drug Leqembi. Schrag also works as an indepedent research integrity consultant and has brought to light a number of important instances of apparent research misconduct which likely had a significant impact on the field of Alzheimer’s research.

Dr Bandrowski trained as a bench neurophysiologist, working to elucidate physiological mechanisms of learning and epilepsy. However, soon after postdoc, Dr. Bandrowski began to work in data, starting with the annotation of the human genome for Celera Inc. Dr. Bandrowski moved to neuroinformatics with the award of the Neuroscience Information Framework by the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience. The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive list of databases for neuroscience, and led to the most comprehensive search system for neuroscience data on the web. Since then, Dr. Bandrowski's role moved to creating data structures that are accessible to multiple systems, or FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable); leading interdisciplinary teams to create community standards, and structuring data into formats that are accessible to artificial intelligence systems. Dr. Bandrowski also serves as the lead for the Research Resource Identification (RRID) Initiative. RRIDs are unique identifiers for Key Biological Resources, aggregated by our group from community databases and requested from authors in participating journals.

In preclinical as well as in clinical studies Ulrich Dirnagl’s research has revealed pathobiology which impact on the outcome after a stroke. These include deleterious as well as endogenous protective mechanisms, as interactions of the brain with other systems of the body after it has been injured. Several of these mechanism can be therapeutically targeted, clinical trials are under way. In addition, through meta-research he was able to identify opportunities for improving research practice and to obtain evidence for the impact of interventions targeted to increase the value of biomedical research. At the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin Ulrich Dirnagl serves as Director of the Department of Experimental Neurology. Since 2017 he is also the founding director of the QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research at the Berlin Institute of Health.
