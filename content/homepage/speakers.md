#### Emily Sena
##### Stroke Association Kirby Laing Foundation Senior Lecturer, University of Edinburgh
##### Editor-in-Chief, BMJ Open Science

Dr Sena is a Stroke Association Kirby Laing Foundation Senior Non-Clinical Lecturer in the Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.
She completed her undergraduate and postdoctoral degrees in Pharmacology and Neuroscience at the Universities of Edinburgh and Melbourne.
She is specialised in the validity of preclinical research and a passionate advocate for open science. Her research interests are in the use of meta-research approaches (research on research) to drive improvements in the validity, transparency and reproducibility of primary research using animal models of human diseases. Her work has informed laboratory practice guidelines, editorial policy and clinical trials design.
Emily is the inaugural Editor-in-Chief of BMJ Open Science, and convenor of CAMARADES - an international collaboration that supports, advances and undertakes systematic reviews of preclinical research.

#### Kirstie Whitaker
##### Programme Lead for Tools, Practices and Systems, The Alan Turing Institute

Kirstie Whitaker leads the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) (London, UK). Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working. She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://2016globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker?3fa4cfa909=) by Foreign Policy magazine. You can find more information at her lab website: [whitakerlab.github.io](https://whitakerlab.github.io/).

#### Ulrich Dirnagl
##### Director, Department of Experimental Neurology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin
##### Founding Director, BIG Quest Center for Transforming Biomedical Research

In preclinical as well as in clinical studies Ulrich Dirnagl’s research has revealed pathobiology which impact on the outcome after a stroke. These include deleterious as well as endogenous protective mechanisms, as interactions of the brain with other systems of the body after it has been injured. Several of these mechanism can be therapeutically targeted, clinical trials are under way. In addition, through meta-research he was able to identify opportunities for improving research practice and to obtain evidence for the impact of interventions targeted to increase the value of biomedical research. At the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin Ulrich Dirnagl serves as Director of the Department of Experimental Neurology. Since 2017 he is also the founding director of the QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research at the Berlin Institute of Health. QUEST aims at overcoming the roadblocks in translational medicine by increasing the value and impact of biomedical research through maximizing the quality, reproducibility, generalizability, and validity of research.

#### Malcolm Macleod
##### Professor of Neurology and Translational Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh
##### Academic Lead for Research Improvement and Research Integrity, University of Edinburgh

Malcolm Macleod is Professor of Neurology and Translational Neurosciences and Academic Lead for Research Improvement and Research Integrity at the University of Edinburgh. With David Howells he co-founded the CAMARADES collaboration in 2005, is Academic Coordinator of the European Quality in Preclinical Data IMI consortium and a member of the UK Reproducibility Network steering committee. His current research interests relate to providing evidence for the effectiveness (or not) of strategies which might be adopted by funders, journals and institutions to improve the quality of their research.

#### Maryann Martone
##### Professor Emeritus, Neurosciences, University of California San Diego

Maryann Martone received her BA from Wellesley College in Biological Psychology and Ancient Greek and her Ph. D. in Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego. She is a professor Emerita at UCSD, but still maintains an active laboratory, the FAIR Data Informatics Lab. She started her career as a neuroanatomist, specializing in light and electron microscopy, but her main research for the past 15 years focused on informatics for neuroscience, i.e., neuroinformatics. She led the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), a national project to establish a uniform resource description framework for neuroscience, and the NIDDK Information Network (dknet), a portal for connecting researchers in digestive, kidney and metabolic disease to data, tools, and materials. She just completed 5 years as Editor-in-Chief of Brain and Behavior, an open access journal. Dr. Martone is past President of FORCE11, an organization dedicated to advancing scholarly communication and e-scholarship. She completed two years as the chair of the Council on Training, Science and Infrastructure for the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility and is now the chair of the Governing Board. Since retiring, she served as the Director of Biological Sciences for Hypothesis, a technology non-profit developing an open annotation layer for the web (2015-2018) and founded SciCrunch, a technology start up based on technologies developed by NIF and dkNET.

#### Jennifer Manly
##### Professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology, Columbia University
#### Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center and the Taub Institute for Research in Aging and Alzheimer’s disease

Dr. Jennifer Manly is a Professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology at the Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer’s Disease and the Aging Brain at Columbia University. Her research focuses on mechanisms of disparities in cognitive aging and dementia. In order to do this research, her research team has partnered with the Black and Latinx communities around Columbia University and around the country to design and carry out investigations of social factors across the lifecourse, such as educational opportunities, racism and discrimination, and socioeconomic status, and how these factors relate to cognition and brain health later in life. Dr. Manly was awarded the Early Career Award from Division 40 of the American Psychological Association in 2002, elected Fellow of APA in 2004, and received the 2020 Paul Satz INS Mentoring Award.  She served on the US Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services from 2011 – 2015 and is a member of the National Advisory Council on Aging.
